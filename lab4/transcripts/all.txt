Genesis 1:1  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
Genesis 1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
Genesis 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
Genesis 1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
Genesis 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it with her
surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme
downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and
cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of
land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

To surrender or relinquish, as sovereign power; to withdraw
definitely from filling or exercising, as a high office, station,
dignity; as, to abdicate the throne, the crown, the papacy.

To provide a polypeptide having ceramidase activity, and a gene encoding thereof useful as an reagent for lipid engineering and as indices for diagnosis of atopic dermatitis, an easy method for detecting the polypeptide and method for detecting the gene as well as a method for detecting atopic dermatitis. A polypeptide having an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 in Sequence Listing, or a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence which has substitution, deletion, addition or insertion of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and having ceramidase activity; a gene encoding the polypeptide; a gene capable of hybridizing with the above genes under stringent conditions, and encoding a polypeptide having ceramidase activity; an oligonucleotide probe or primer, which is capable of hybridizing under stringent conditions with the above genes or with a gene having a nucleotide sequence complementary thereto; a method for detecting a gene encoding a polypeptide having ceramidase activity, by using the oligonucleotide probe and/or primer; an antibody or a fragment thereof, which is capable of specifically binding to the polypeptide; a method for detecting a polypeptide having ceramidase activity, by using the above antibody or fragment thereof; a method for detecting atopic dermatitis, by the methods. 

My liege, this haste was hot in question,
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight: when all athwart there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
A thousand of his people butchered;
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
Such beastly shameless transformation,
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
Without much shame retold or spoken of.
