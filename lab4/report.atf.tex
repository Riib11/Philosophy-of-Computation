In this lab, I benchmarked Google Translate's (GT) performance on a multi-lingual translation task.
The goal was to measure roughly how well GT performed at difficult translation tasks and how language-choice and transcript-style affected the performance.




For input transcripts, I used several English transcripts in writing styles ranging from old-English prose to patent specification.
This variety is meant to tease out possibly effects that (1) some writing styles have on GT's ability to translate English phrases across many languages at a time due to the commonality of their grammatical and semantical structures.





For languages, I picked from the top and bottom of the ranking of languages by number of native speakers.
Each group is focused on in its own experiment (experiments 1 and 2).
This choice of languages is meant to emphasize any differences that are yielded in GT's performance by the commonality of the languages used in terms of how many examples exist for the GT algorithm to train on. This is, of course, allowing the reasonable assumption that training examples commonality roughly correlates with number of native speakers.


\section{Transcript Setup}


I selected transcript sections that reflect a variety of writing styles, including modern English, English, technical writing, storytelling, and English translated from other languages. The full text of each transcript can be found in the appendix.

\section{Translation task}


Start with a sequence of languages $L_0, \dots, L_n$ and a transcript in $L_0$, called the \textit{original transcript.}
GT translates the $L_0$-transcript to $L_1$, and then translates the resulting $L_1$-transcript to $L_2$, and so on until the transcript has been translated to $L_n$.
At the end, there is left a $L_n$-transcript.
Then, GT translates this $L_n$-transcript back to $L_0$ - the result is the \textit{processed transcript}.
The differences between the original and processed transcripts are measured to rate GT's success at this task.
The goal of this scoring is to rate GT according to how well it preserve the meaning and grammatic structure of the original transcript.


\section{Translation Success Measure}


I rated GT's success at the task by how close the processed transcript was to the original transcript in terms of meaning and grammar. For each of these dimensions, I categorized an ranking of ordered performance classes.




\textbf{Grammar} is how properly-constructed the processed transcript is according to the rules of $L_0$ and the grammatical structure of the original transcript.
The following are the classes of grammar performance I partitioned in order of increasing success.
They are meant to be ``evenly spaced'' in the space of deviations from the exact grammar and structure of the original transcript.
\begin{align*} \begin{array}{r|l}
\text{Grammar Class} & \text{Description} \\ \hline
1 & \text{completely confused} \\
2 & \text{mostly confused} \\
3 & \text{often confused} \\
4 & \text{sparsely confused} \\
5 & \text{effectively perfect}
\end{array} \end{align*}




\textbf{Meaning} is how close the processed transcript is to the original transcript in meaning.
The following are the classes of meaning performance I partitioned in order of increasing success.
They are meant to be ``evenly spaced'' in the space of deviations from reflecting the exact meaning of the original transcript.
\begin{align*} \begin{array}{r|l}
\text{Meaning Class} & \text{Description} \\ \hline
1 & \text{irrelevant} \\
2 & \text{sparsely relevant} \\
3 & \text{often relevant} \\
4 & \text{mostly accurate} \\
5 & \text{effectively perfect} \\
\end{array} \end{align*}





The \textbf{Euclidean Total}, $E$ is a combination of the grammar and meaning scores according the Euclidean distance formula:
\begin{align*}  E(g,m) := \sqrt{(5-g)^2 + (5-m)^2}  \end{align*} \vspace*{0.1cm}
The motivation for this score is the conception of the grammar and meaning scores as being measures along orthogonal feature axes.
So, the distance in this 2D space from $(0,0)$ represents how far from the perfect translation the processed transcript is.
A lower $E$ indicates a better translation.
The assumption that the grammar and meaning axes are orthogonal is likely false, but it is a useful approximation.


\section{Predictions}


In regards to language speaker counts, I hypothesized that GT will perform better on these languages than the languages in Experiment 2 because I assume that (1) having more native speakers correlates with having more training data for GT's algorithms, and (2) having more data to train on yields a more accurate GT in the ways measured by this experiment. Assumption 1 seems very likely in general, but assumption 2 maybe depends heavily on how exactly GT works and whether it actually works well at all.





In regards to transcript style, I hypothesized that GT will perform better the more technical and less artsy the transcript. For example, I think that it will not well-maintain neither the grammatical structure nor meaning of the Shakespeare prose because it contains analogies and uncommon grammatic structures.

\section{Analysis}\subsection{Comparing Languages}


Figure 5 records the differences between experiments of the score means for all features of each transcript used.
The \textit{difference} of the mean score for feature $F$ is calculated by subtracting the mean of $F$ in experiment 1 from the mean of $F$ is experiment 2.



\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=15cm,keepaspectratio]{images/lang-diffs-all-table.png}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \caption{Figure 5. Table of the differences between experiments of the means for all features of each transcript.}
\end{figure}



The results show that GT's performance with uncommon languages (the languages used in experiment 2) scored on average 1.32 points lower in grammar, 1.44 points lower in meaning, and 1.94 points higher in Euclidean total than GT's performance with common languages (the languages used in experiment 1). So as hypothesized, GT performed much worse with languages for which there is little training data in comparison to languages for which there is vast amounts of training data. In the range of the Euclidean total this is the significant drop of $  1.94/ \sqrt{50} \approx 27.4\%  $ of the total range.





This drop in performance is very consistent across the different transcripts, which suggests that this is indeed the observation of a systematic effect rather than a random bias in GT's performance; the standard deviations in the score differences are 0.23, 0.62, and 0.51 for grammar, meaning and Euclidean total respectively.





This data corresponds well to my subjective experience of reading the processed transcripts. There was a clear qualitative drop in performance when I transitioned from experiment 1 to experiment 2; most common grammatical structures and words with several meaning were maintained in experiment 1 but were almost always completely lost in experiment 2. For example, ``My liege, this haste was hot in question'' from Shakespeare was caught pretty well in experiment 1 but was almost always echoed as something to do with heat or questioning in experiment 2, such as ``My sleep was a sudden heat'' in trial 1. That example sounds like it could be an idiom in some language alien to me, but it definitely does not match Shakespeare.

\end{figure}



The Bible certainly was translated the best by far. I'd suggest that it is because the section was the shortest and has short sentences, so I may have been systematically biased in my subjective scoring because there is less space for GT to make a serious error. However the Bible translations were comparatively excellent in experiment 2 in the context GT's performance of the other texts in experiment 2, the this result does seem legitimate to some degree.





patentsample.txt scored middling, but Moby Dick, the Dictionary, and Shakespeare all scored the worst within a close range. Moby Dick and Shakespeare support my original hypothesis that these older-styled texts would be more difficult to translate, but with the Bible being a strange outlier. The Dictionary was relatively unexpected by my hypotheses, and while reading the processed texts I noticed that many of the words in the definition of abdicate, such as ``relinquish,'' were commonly switched out for something irrelevant. Additionally, the semi-colon-connected lengthy sentence of the definition is certainly uncommon in the context of most of the kinds of text I would guess that GT is trained on.


\section{Conclusions}


The results well support my original hypothesis that GT would perform better on languages with many native speakers as opposed to less. Along with the assumption that the number of native speakers correlates roughly with the amount of information for GT to train on, this confirmation suggests that the GT training process does indeed improve its performance with more data - a piece of evidence that GT works as advertised and that neural networks (part of GT's training algorithm) work well for translation.





GT had no problems translating an English translation of the Bible, which was a surprise. Perhaps the style of religious, biblical language has echoes in the texts used for other languages and lead to GT having relatively more experience translating this style. Or, perhaps more likely, the Bible has been translated into many other languages including all of those used in experiment 2 and so GT has already seen text almost exactly similar to the Bible.





GT had special problems with the definition of abdicate, Shakespeare and Moby Dick. The old-English style of writing in Shakespeare and Moby Dick apparently had great effect on GT's ability to translate grammatical structure and make sense of words that have several possible meaning, leading GT to form incorrect structures with irrelevant words. as for the definition of abdicate, this was also the case as well as the uncommon grammatical structure of a dictionary definition turning into sentence fragments or sometimes just nonsense in some trials of experiment 2.





Altogether, these observations point the conclusions that GT works better the more recent textual data it has to train on, and that artsy writing styles can severely handicap machine translation. Since this sort of data is become more and more available --- more available than ever before --- GT will likely continue to improve in commonly-used languages such as English and the languages in experiment 1. However, since data for lesser-used languages such as those in experiment 2 are not produced at the same rate, the performance gap between experiment 1 languages and experiment 2 languages is likely to increase. This does not take into account tangential breakthroughs in machine translation though, which also seem very likely; this is merely one factor in a complex formula for the future of GT. I suspect that progress in machine translation algorithms themselves will have a much larger impact on GT's future success, for much of the textual data available may not currently be of optimal training use, as demonstrated by GT's relative failure with the patentsample.txt transcript.

Original transcript:

\begin{displayquote}
My liege, this haste was hot in question,
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight: when all athwart there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
A thousand of his people butchered;
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
Such beastly shameless transformation,
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
Without much shame retold or spoken of.

God, this haste problem is very hot,
And many more restrictions.
But tonight: when everyone is here.
There are several new features in an article in Wales.
Worst, who is the great mortimer,
Bring people here to fight
Against irregular and wild glow,
She was taken with the shameless arm of Welsh.
One thousand of them were massacred.
The bodies are such violations.
It's a shameful change
Perhaps for these Welsh women.
There is not much shame in repeating or saying.


\item 
As a liar, this question is very hot,
We have established many billing limits
But calm: when all athletes come.
Wales publications are full of breaking news;
The worst is the great dead.
The leaders go to Hereford to fight.
Irregular irregular glow,
This is Wilchman's strong hand.
There are a thousand butchers.
Who damages your body?
This shameful change
It can be done by a Welsh woman who can not afford it.
There is not much shame, retirement or conversation.



\item 
My lie, this craze is very hot on this issue,
Pregnancy is subject to many restrictions.
But serenity: when all the athletes are coming.
The Welsh post is full of breaking news.
The worst is Mortimer's greatness.
These people were taken to Hereford to fight
Fighting irregularities and wild glow
Take a hard Welsh hand,
A butcher of a thousand people.
Who has been misused by your body?
These obvious changes,
This can be done by a Welshman who can not
Not too shy, retiring or talking.

As a lie, the craze over the issue is very hot.
And it offers many restrictions
But last night: all the ramps are coming on.
News published in Wales is full of important news;
Worst, Mortimer is great,
Ordering fighters of Herefordshire
Against irregular and wild glue,
I have a Welsh monk
One thousand of them were killed.
There the body was abused,
It's a shameful and cruel change
What can be done by those vilgium is not
There is no shame listed or spoken.

My sleep was a sudden heat
And many other criminal cases have been identified
At night, everything from and close
Welle positions are tricky questions.
Horse, good mortar,
The struggle for the people of yahaundaphordasayarama
Unusual glendavara and dry,
They hit by vellyandako
Thousands of people were killed.
When their body is persecuted,
This is an important translation
The same is true of women in Wales
Shame or needless to mention.


\item 
A liar, chest in the chest,
There are many numbers set
But do not enter: where all artists come
Full of English with full space;
and
More Arferdshire men fought
Whether it's inappropriate or wild,
Watch Valentine's wonders,
Thousands have been raped.
What kinds of abuse on these devices,
Such a change,
Wales
Talking too much.


\item 
My lie and my chest were hot with this problem
And the money was banned many times
But yirnerne: where the artists come from
Loading weight avatar avatar
then
Men fight for airbags
Unusual and clever wildlife,
He wanted a great talent
Thousands of people fell.
What is their carcass?
Such changes are abusive bessandeha
As Welsh Women Can Do
Talk more without talking.


\item 
This was my question of disappointment
There are many limitations for the award
But at night, when all the tourists arrive
The Polish message was completely opened in Welsh.
Gentlemen,
Hufffordshire people were fighters
Wenjing and Wenzhou against Glenn
To bring a Welsh Welsh hand,
Thousands of people are killed.
Such a type of body was abusive.
Without migration, such horrible,
Welsh, Yo
It's not embarrassing to back or chat.
